# List Pagination and Filtering
 A project that uses pagination to enhance the usability of a web page. In this project I use JavaScript to divide a long list into a series of "pages". I also added a search component to the page using JavaScript, wrote code to paginate the search results and handle a situation where there are no results returned.
